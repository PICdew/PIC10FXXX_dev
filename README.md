# PIC10FXXX_dev
Simple, cheap PIC10FXXX development board with in circuit programming capability
This is described on my website here:

From the description

This design was  targeted at the 6/8 pin PIC10F202/10F206 devices. Microchip provide a number 6 or 8 pin devices 
using the same footprint, which work with this board. To make it easier for development, the board uses the 8 pin DIP
 versions as it makes it easier to swap devices, something that is difficult with the SOT-23 variants.
 The design aims were as shown here:

Be capable of supporting the PIC10F202/PIC10F206
In circuit programmable using the PICKIT2/3 programmer.
Be able to mechanically support the PIC10F202 ICD module.
Provide 2-4 switched inputs.
Provide LED outputs.
Small PCB.
Provide user access to GPIO pins and
Powered from a +5V supply.

Board is easily fabricated by the hobbyist.
